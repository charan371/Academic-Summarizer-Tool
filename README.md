# Academic-Summarizer-Tool

This is an Academic Summarizer Tool created to summarize and recommend research paper abstracts.
There are 1200 reserach paper abstracts in the database which consist of a wide variety of topics based on domains and sub-domains.

This project is built using Open Source Large Language Models like HuggingFace Models, MCP Server, MCP Client and CrewAI Agentic Framework and is run using the T4 GPU in Google Colab.

For user reference the dataset of 1200 papers is being attached. If anyone wants to extract papers on their own, a function is laid out in the notebook which will do that for you. 

Thank You for visiting our project.

Happpy Coding!
